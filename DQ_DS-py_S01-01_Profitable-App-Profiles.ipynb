    "Based on our analysis, the average numbers of reviews of *Navigation*, *Reference*, *Social Networking* and *Music* apps are skewed by giant companies. Except for *Reference*, all these apps are energy-, time- and cost-demanding to build. Additionally, they have special requirements such as community-building expertise, paid access to GPS API etc. Not to mention that competitions with big players such as *Google Map*, *Facebooks*, etc are very tough. Therefore, it is too risky for us to build these kinds of apps (*Navigation*, *Social Networking* and *Music*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also notice that *Reference* and *Book* genres overlap with each other. Both of them have **high user engagement and they are relatively easier, faster and cheaper to build**. Therefore, ***Reference* and *Book* exhibit some potentials in the apps market**. What we need to do is to **offer some unique and practical features** to the apps that we are going to build to attract and engage the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other apps that have a high number of reviews as well include *Weather*, *Finance* and *Food & Drink*:\n",
    "- *Weather*: these apps usually only engage users for a very short time. Thus, weather apps are not so attractive to us from both user engagement and in-app ads perspectives.\n",
    "- *Finance*: building finance apps require financial, cybersecurity and legal expertise. Moreover, finance apps market is dominated by big Fintech and Bank players. Therefore, they are too cost- and expertise-demanding for us to build.\n",
    "- *Food and drinks*: these apps are mainly owned by big food and drink chains and food delivery companies, and it is not the business area that we are interested in (i.e. apps development). Furthermore, users usually only use the apps to order and track their orders, i.e. low user engagement in our perspective. Thus, it is less interesting to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although *Game* apps dominate App Store, they do not have a very high number of users in comparison to some of the apps that we mentioned above. This indicates that *Game* apps market is saturated, while the demand is not so high. Therefore, *Game* is less interesting to us."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Altogether, we concluded that ***Book* and *Reference* genres show potential in both App Store and Google Play datasets**, as they **attract a significant number of users and posses considerable high engagement rate** due to the nature of the apps. Furthermore, they are **relatively easier, faster and cheaper to build**. All these factors are crucial in increasing the profitability of our company via in-app ads on the free apps that we build. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to distinguish our apps from other apps by **focusing on niches with high market value and providing unique features that serve users' goals**. For example, the popularity of *Dictionary* and *Translation* apps on both stores indicates this area has a high market value. For example, we can build a *Picture Book* app with the addition of interactive games for learning the vocabulary of foreign languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although pregnancy ([Ref: Pregnancy Product Market](https://illadelink.com/global-pregnancy-product-market-value-projected-to-surge-remarkably-at-double-digit-cagr-during-2020-2026-zion-market-research/)) and baby care ([Ref: Baby Personal Care Market Size](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/baby-personal-care-market)) have huge market values, there are not many guides on app stores yet. This can also be an interesting niche for us, as a guide type of apps is popular. For instance, we can build a free *Guide for Pregnancy or Baby Care* with interactive features, supportive online community and good user experience to engage our users and subsequently attract more advertisers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our data analysis provides us with an area of focus for conducting proper and extensive market research and user research before developing apps. Subsequently, it helps us to make informed business decisions in building the right apps, which will eventually assist us in achieving our business goal."
